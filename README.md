## Africas Talking  API
- You can access the api once you register with the company.
- There are 2 ways of using the api:
1. Use the SDK version, whereby the company has made good progress to encapsulate most
   complexities like headers and requests. (text.py).
2. Use the raw native api, where you'll work with 4 components that constitutes most api's:
   Endpoints, Headers, Data[dictionary form] and response. (send_sms.py).
